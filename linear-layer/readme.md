# Linear Layer Optimization

The linear layer optimization focuses on enhancing the permutation layer within the SPN (Substitution-Permutation Network) cipher. This involves the development and application of an advanced Optimization of Permutation Operations (OPO) algorithm, which streamlines and improves the efficiency of permutation operations.

The key implementation of the OPO algorithm is documented in the Jupyter Notebook file, [optimize_permutation.ipynb](optimize_permutation.ipynb). This notebook contains the latest methodologies and techniques used in the optimization process, presenting a refined approach compared to older versions of the optimization workflow.

This structured approach ensures that the permutation layer achieves higher computational efficiency and robustness, directly contributing to the overall performance and security of the SPN cipher.
