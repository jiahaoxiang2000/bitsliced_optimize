This repository contains the source code for the paper "Optimal Low-Latency Implementation of Bitsliced Cipher for RISC Processors" 

## Contents

- `sbox-bgc`: This is a novel encoding method optimized for the Bit-slice Gate Complexity (BGC) model. It is primarily used for optimizing the S-box.
- `ARM-M4`: This refers to the implementation of the encryption algorithm specifically designed for the ARM Cortex-M4 processor.
